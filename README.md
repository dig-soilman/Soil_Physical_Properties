# Soil Physical Properties

Is a Open Educational Resource treatise introducing, and briefly describing, physical properties of soils. It emphasizes examples to quantify the soil and gives examples of classing several measurments to better understand how to employ soil as a precious natural resource for productivity and conservation.

This treatise is envisioned to be parterned with other treatises of a more complete post secondary upper division treatment introducing a broader spectrum of the science of soil. Currently, a proposed title of the greater work is **Start with Soil**. 

Candidate topics for the proposed **Start with Soil** book rely on a fundamental knowledge of the physical properties of soils to fully leverage said additional topics of interest.

***This treatise is beta and is under active edits and revisions. As such, I expect corrections active in August and September 2022.***

Select the greatest number beta version file name. Choose to read or Download the file. Example Soil_Physical_Properties_beta0.7.1.pdf. The version is at the end of the file name durring the active edit period.

## Source code

The book source code is LaTeX and is available in the repository.

One use of the source when this gets out of beta is for instructors to make small adjustments for their class, such as adding an exercise or a special topic. Feel free to contribute with suggested edits and additions, but please also include a statement so that people know who to write with bug reports. Put something like this on the docuent cover: \fbox{\parbox{0.75\textwidth}{The appendix on Darcy's Law has been added by Professor Fellow of University. For this material contact \url{fellow@example.edu}.}}

Additionally, in the LaTeX code adding 

% dig-soilman begin addtion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a LaTeX comment can be quite helpful toward collaborations.
   
% dig-soilman end addtion

The LaTex has some comments and ToDo's as well as some commented Markdown for tables.
