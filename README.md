# Soil Physical Properties

Is a Open Educational Resource text introducing and briefly describing physical properties of soils necessary to quantify the soil and better understand how to employ it as a precious natural resource for productivity and conservation.

This book is envisioned as becoming a chapter of a more complete post secondary upper division treatment introducing a broader spectrum of the science of soil. Currently, a proposed title of the greater work is **Start with Soil**. 

Candidate topics for the proposed **Start with Soil** book rely on a fundamental knowledge of the physical properties of soils to fully leverage said additional topics of interest.

***This book is under active edits and revisions. As such, I cannot suggest that it be employed/deployed as a teaching resource YET.***

## Source code

The book source code is LaTeX and is available in the repository.

One use of the source is for instructors to make small adjustments for their class, such as adding an exercise or a special topic. Feel free, but please also include a statement so that people know who to write with bug reports. Put something like this on the cover: \fbox{\parbox{0.75\textwidth}{The appendix on Darcy's Law has been added by Professor Fellow of UCD. For this material contact \url{fellow@example.edu}.}}

Additionally, adding 

% dig-soilman begin addtion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a LaTeX comment can be quite helpful toward collaborations.
   
% dig-soilman end addtion
